            Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we
            know ourselves? In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal.
            Not if I weaken first. Damage report! Flair is what marks the
            difference between artistry and mere competence. You bet I'm
            agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Your
            shields were failing, sir. I guess it's better to be lucky than
            good. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training.
            Well, that's certainly good to know. Commander William Riker of the
            Starship Enterprise. Did you come here for something in particular
            or just general Riker-bashing? Computer, lights up! Fear is the true
            enemy, the only enemy. Congratulations - you just destroyed the
            Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Besides, you look good
            in a dress.
